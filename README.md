## AstEscSolver

## Description
This application can solve levels of the game called Asteroid Escape[https://www.smartgames.eu/uk/one-player-games/asteroid-escape]. 

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation
The app can be started by running the .jar file. You need to have java to run it.

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
If you have some ideas or problems feel free to create an issue.

## License
For open source projects, say how it is licensed.
